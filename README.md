In this project I made a class Actor which is going to have all the variables and method that the player and the enemy have. Both player and enemies are going to inheritate the Actor class
The difference between the player and the enemy is the enemy has it own AI method for movement. I thought of giving the player a score variable but in the end I didn't use it, so I eliminated it in the script
The generation of the tilemap is in a specific script, and it create it own class that is called tilemap
A create a health system class which the all actors are going to have it, in there, I coded everything that has to do with stats and calculation.
I tried to create a class to do the battle system but I had so many problems that I included in the main class, Game1. The same happend with the movement of the player and enemy.
